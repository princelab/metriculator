  s.description = %{Archiver provides a tool for managing and automating the storage of data produced by Thermo LTQ series MS instruments to collect all files from each run and archive them to a storage/archive location.  Also incorporated is the automatic (user specified settings) generation of performance metrics from the NIST metric package.  Additionally, there are user specified alerts and a graphing system for the generation of comparisons between metrics. Finally, the whole package is brought together into a database for long-term information storage, and a website front-end for user experience and simplified viewing.  }
