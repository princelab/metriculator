#This file is a running list of things to accomplish to finish the project

##TODO list (111102)

###Archiver
-	Metric starter fxnality  # TEST THIS!!
*	Message Passing # TEST IT and the accompanying metric starting...
* Message clearing fxns so that I can clean out the lists... maybe monthly?
* Implement database updating of locations and the file moving system

###Website
  - Tracking of what metric comparisons are already produced and available for viewing (Ensure they can't be recreated)
    - Prevent the same comparison from being created multiple times?
      - How can this be done??
  - Add breadcrumbs for graph heirarchy?
      -- might be had by the simple "up" link I've added.
  - figure out how to AJAX update the alerts page  
  - Make a special viewing page for any graphs that are significantly different (T-test) __????  Would this really help???__
    * Or a page of links to the images?
  * http://www.datatables.net/ ????  Would this make that table easier?

###Database

###Tests
* Why is the integration test stufff not working? MetricsController,
  MsrunsController.





#Finished
* Convert the Knowntrends hash to one more like the QC defaults one... where each object can be set individually
